# Instant Feedback System

The project that is to be implemented during this Internship Program aims to create a platform that would ease the process of giving feedback for presentations that take place in our office. <br><br>
From speakerâ€™s point of view, receiving feedback is very useful. First of all he/she can see that people enjoyed the presentationEntity, and in best cases, the audience can give some constructive remarks that will definitely help the speaker improve himself.
